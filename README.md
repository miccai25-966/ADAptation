# How to Run the Code üõ†
### Environment Installation
### 1. Stage 1 & 2: Training ControlNet+Diffusion Model on source domain dataset and Inference.
For setting up the environment and training the source model, please refer to the [[ControlNet]]([https://github.com/whq-xxh/SFADA-GTV-Seg](https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet)) project. Please note that some hyperparameters, such as the image input resolution and Condition Detector, may need to be adjusted.

### 2. Stage 3: HyperSphere-based for Contrastive Learning.
